  "notes": "gl_periods defines periods and fiscal calendars used across ledgers for accounting and reporting. It captures period metadata such as period_name, period_type, and period_set_name, which together form the composite primary key. Key columns include period_year (fiscal year), adjustment_flag (Y if it is an adjustment period allowing date overlaps), period_num (sequential number of the period in a fiscal year), start_date, and end_date. Each period is uniquely identified within its period set and type, and no two periods can overlap unless flagged as an adjustment period. This table underpins accurate time-based financial control across all ledgers.",
